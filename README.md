Developing AI systems for real-world impact | Deep Learning, NLP &amp; Healthcare Innovation


Hi there!

I'm Ankita Haldar — an AI/ML engineering student passionate about building intelligent systems that create real value in healthcare and assistive technologies.

- Currently working on a **Dementia Patient Memory Tracking System** integrating Deep Learning and NLP for cognitive monitoring and early-stage dementia assessment.  
- Exploring **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Full-Stack Development** to build scalable and efficient AI applications.  
- Open to collaborations where technology can be used to solve meaningful real-world problems in healthcare.
